Challenge Problems

    Problem 1 (Obtuse Triangles, Side Lengths Independent):  Two sides are independently and randomly assigned a length
    in the range from 0 to 1. The third side has a fixed length of 1. Select only those that successfully form a
    triangle. What is the probability that the triangle formed is obtuse?
    
    Problem 2 
    
    Problem 3 (Rod in 3 Pieces, Triangle?): Form three sides from a rod of length one by randomly selecting two
    breakpoints. What is the probability that a triangle can be constructed from the resulting pieces?
    
    Problem 4 (Broken Rod Obtuse Triangles): For challenge problem 3, consider the subset of broken rods that form
    triangles. What is the probability that the triangle is obtuse?
    
    Problem 5 (Broken Rod, Selected 2nd Break): For challenge problem 3, after the first breakpoint is chosen, select
    the longer of the two pieces for the second breakpoint (randomly chosen along its length). What is the probability
    that a triangle can be constructed?
    
    Problem 6 (Darts): There is a circular dartboard of radius one. Two darts are randomly thrown upon its surface.
    What is the probability that they are at least one unit apart?
    
    Problem 7 (3 Points on the Circumference): Select three points on a circle as follows: fix one point on the
    circumference and distribute the other two at angles A and B from the first point. The angles are taken from the
    origin relative to the first point. A and B are chosen randomly from the range 0 to 2pi. What is the probability
    that the origin is contained within the triangle formed from the points on the circumference?
 
    Problem 8 (Six Teams):
    
    Problem 9 (Golf):
    
    Problem 10 (Urn):
    
    Problem 11 (Die):
    
    Problem 12 (Coefficients):
