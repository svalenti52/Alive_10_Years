Challenge Problems

    Problem 1 (Obtuse Triangles, Side Lengths Independent):  Two sides are independently and randomly
    assigned a length in the range from 0 to 1. The third side has a fixed length of 1. Select only
    those that successfully form a triangle. What is the probability that the triangle formed is
    obtuse?
    
    Problem 2 
    
    Problem 3 (Rod in 3 Pieces, Triangle?): Form three sides from a rod of length one by randomly
    selecting two breakpoints. What is the probability that a triangle can be constructed from the
    resulting pieces?
    
    Problem 4 (Broken Rod Obtuse Triangles): For challenge problem 3, consider the subset of broken
    rods that form triangles. What is the probability that the triangle is obtuse?
    
    Problem 5 (Broken Rod, Selected 2nd Break): For challenge problem 3, after the first breakpoint is
    chosen, select the longer of the two pieces for the second breakpoint (randomly chosen along its
    length). What is the probability that a triangle can be constructed?
    
    Problem 6 (Darts): There is a circular dartboard of radius one. Two darts are randomly thrown upon
    its surface. What is the probability that they are at least one unit apart?
    
    Problem 7 (3 Points on the Circumference): Select three points on a circle as follows: fix one
    point on the circumference and distribute the other two, on the circumference, at angles A and B
    from the first point. The angles are taken from the origin relative to the first point. Angles A
    and B are chosen randomly from the range 0 to 2pi. What is the probability that the origin is
    contained within the triangle formed from the points on the circumference?
 
    Problem 8 (Six Teams): Six teams, all of equal ability, form a league and play a long series of
    games against each other each year. How many years must they play until the probability reaches
    0.5 that the same team wins 3 years in a row? The same question for 10 teams.
    
    Problem 9 (Golf): A golfer drives a ball onto a square green randomly (equally likly to be
    anywhere on the green). At the center of the green is the hole. What is the probability that the
    ball is closer to the hole than an edge of the green?
    
    Problem 10 (Urn): There are b black balls and w white balls in an urn (b, w > 0). The following
    procedure is executed:
        1. Draw a ball from the urn, noting its color, and discarding it.
        2. Draw another ball from the urn.
        3. If it matched the color from step 1, discard it, and go to step 2.
        4. If it did not match the color from step 1, return it to the urn and go to step 1.
    When there is one ball left, what is the probability it is a black ball?
    
    Problem 11 (Die): A and B roll a six-sided die with the one first rolling a 1 winning the round.
    A rolls first by rolling the die once; if A does not win, then B rolls the die once. If B does
    not win, then A rolls the die twice. If A still has not won, then B rolls the die twice. A and B
    continue in like fashion, imcrementing the number of consecutive rolls taken by a player after B
    has rolled and still has not won. What is the probability that A wins?
    
    Problem 12 (A^(2/3) + B^(2/3)): Let A and B be chosen randomly from the range -1 to 1.
    What is the probability that the above function evaluates to less than one?
    
Chapter 1 - Breaking Sticks

    Problem: Make m marks along the length of stick of length 1, distributing the marks randomly along
    its length.  Then break the stick into n pieces, the breakpoints being distributed randomly along
    the length of the stick. What is probability that all m marks are contained within the same broken
    seqment of stick?

Chapter 2 - The Twins

    Problem: A class has 20 students, one set of twins being among them.  If students are assigned
    randomly into groups of 4 students, what is the probability that the twins are in the same group?

Chapter 3 - Steve's Elevator Problem

    This is the same problem as seen previously in Digital Dice. A complete, general, noncombinatoric
    analytical solution was presented that had been found by one of his readers.

Chapter 4 - Three Gambling Problems

    Problem 1: For a six sided die, what is the expected number of tosses till two sixes appear on
    consecutive rolls?
    
    Problem 2: What is the probability of throwing 4 heads before 7 tails? The fairness of the coin
    can be varied.
    
    Problem 3: Players A, B, and C toss a fair die. They toss in the order A, B, C, then repeating.
    The player that throws a six drops out. This continues till there is one player left. What is the
    probability that A, then subsequently B throw sixes? Same question for B, then A.

Chapter 5 - Big Quotients - Part 1

    Problem: Choose two numbers at random from the unit interval. What is the probablity that
    the ratio of the larger number to the smaller is greater that a given number?

Chapter 11 - The Problem of the n-Liars

    Problem: Given that n people tell the truth with a common probability p, what is the 
    probability that something told to a chain of them individually, secretly, and with
    probabilities of truth being independent for each one, that the original message comes
    out? The "chain" refers to them being in a line, the first one told secretly the message,
    the first then secretly telling the second, and so on. The possibilities for the message
    are greatly simplified by allowing it to be "yes" or "no" only.
